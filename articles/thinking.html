<i id='subheading'>Nothing is either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.</i>

<p>There is a common story that gets told: During his morning routine, a worker gets held up in some irritating way. Maybe his kid spills mild or he burns his pants while ironing &ndash; something generally taken as a negative occurs, and it slows up  his usual progress. Once in his car and on his way to work, the man witnesses an accident directly in front of him. The implication, of course, being if the irritating event had not occured, this greater trajedy would have befallen him instead.</p>

<p>Even in this scenario, the situation can be extrapolated more. Maybe due to traffic, he arrives at work at a time maintainence is repairing the elevator, so he must take the stairs. While huffing and puffing to his eighth floor office, he suffers a heart attact from exertion. He survives and while recovering, he decides to live a healthier lifestyle. Through his efforts, his children also take better care of their health. This can go on forever.</p>

<p>With the perspective of hindsight, we can easily see that the original cause &ndash; the burned pants &ndash; had so many effects on the world, that the even itself was neither good or bad. The pants themselves were made of some material that would have worn out or been stained eventually, and been rendered unwearable. The moment they became burned (and thereby unwearable) was inevitable.</p>

<p>If the man was like most humans, he was upset by the pants situation. For one thing, he felt a diminishment of himself as he identified the pants as belonging to him. Also, his pain was caused by the unexpectedness of the situation. Surely, he planned to wear the pants. He probably bought them with intent to wear them until he made a concious decision to trash them.</p>

<p>As we've noticed, though, there was no reason to hold the pants to such expectations. So in the moment of the burning and his reaction, the only purpose his unhappiness was filling was simply to be unhappiness. If the man had the benefit of foresight, he would has seen both the benefits and drawbacks of the event.</p>

<p>Don't let any situation upset you. Your disposition will not change the situation, and if poor, will only serve to stress you.</p>
